Eldertech Scripts
=================

### Description
An online repository to store online backups of scripts written for Eldertech. Most, i.e. all, scripts are written in Powershell and are meant to be run on Windows machines running  at least Powershell 2.0. You must also have administrative priveleges to run most of these scripts as most of them entail the creation and deletion of files.

### Using the Repo
If you have questions about setting up and running scripts read the pages in the **Basic_Guides** folder. 

The actual scripts are housed in the **Scripts_Library** folder.

### Contact Info

If you have any questions about the scripts feel free to contact me.
