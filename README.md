Eldertech Scripts
=================

## The Library


### Description
This is a **Private** repository. Only collaborators, which currently only consists of me, can see the content. It is used to store online backups and descriptions of scripts written for Eldertech. Most, i.e. all, scripts are written in Powershell and are meant to be run on Windows machines running  at least Powershell 2.0. You must also have administrative priveleges to run most of these scripts as a good deal of them entail the creation and deletion of files.

### Using the Repo

If you have questions about setting up and running scripts read the pages in the **Basic_Guides** folder. 

The actual scripts are housed in the **Scripts_Library** folder.


## Other Information


### License

There is no license on this repository so by default I retain the rights, or maybe Eldertech does, I don't know all the legal ins and outs but I'd be fine with it either way. 

### Disclaimer

This is a repository that I currently run on my own. It wasn't asked of me by anyone in the team so any problem you have with its content is a problem with me, Anthony Forsythe, and not Eldertech. My contact info is below so feel free to message me with any issues or concerns.

### Contact Info

If you have any questions about the scripts feel free to contact me.
