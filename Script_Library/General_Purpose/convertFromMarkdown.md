### Purpose

To convert all markdown files in a directory to some other format such as PDF, Word, or HTML

### How to Use

1. Before running the script...
   * In the getUserData function make sure that in the hash table $userData, "pandocPath" is set to the correct path of pandoc.
2. When prompted enter the following...
   1. The path to the folder containing the markdown files.
   2. Whether you want it to search for files recursively or not. 
      * Searching recursively finds ALL markdown files in the directory, in its subfolders, etc.
3. Run the script.
